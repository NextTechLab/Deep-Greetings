have they nothing better to do than haunt my house? 
it's getting too frightening for man or mouse! 

in masks and gowns we haunt the street,
 and knock on doors for trick or treat.
tonight we are the king and queen, 
for oh tonight it's halloween!

said the third, "cover up her ugly toes."
"her broom," said the fourth, "can scratch you--that i know!"
"i'm scared," said the fifth. 
"i think we'd better go."

oh no, not again, the time is near,
 it always happens at this time of year. 
the hissing of unlucky balck cat,
 and ovrhead all the screeching bats.

dance and they don't sing,
they don't have hair.
they don't meow, 
they don't look much like a cow.

shape and size, a pointy nose,
 a jagged mouth and two enormous eyes. 
we set it in a window and we put a candle in,
 then lit it up 

up with candy and sweets,
 don't go out on devil's night.
 stay in your bed and keep on the light,
 little demons and ghouls have their fun all right, outside.

plumpest sort they sell,
 we neatly scooped the inside out
 and only left the shell.
 we carved a funny funny-face of silly shape and size

on halloween day, 
when you know all the ghouls and ghosts are away. 
they hate the daylight, "it's no fun,"
 they say. so just please, please wait

see what can't be seen on any other night.
skeletons and ghosts and ghouls,
 grinning goblins fighting duels, 
werewolves rising from their tombs,
 witches on their magic brooms

trick or treat with me?
there was an old witch.
believe it if you can,
she tapped on the windows and she ran, ran, ran.
